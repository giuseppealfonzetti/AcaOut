\usage{
predict_exam_completion(
  FIT,
  CUTOFF_YEAR,
  HORIZON,
  YEAR_LENGTH = 365,
  GRAD_EXTENSION = 1.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{FIT}{Fitted object returned by \code{\link[=fit_EM]{fit_EM()}} or \code{\link[=fit_BFGS]{fit_BFGS()}}.}

\item{CUTOFF_YEAR}{Consider data up to the end of \code{CUTOFF_YEAR}.}

\item{HORIZON}{Strictly positive integer specifying how many academic years
ahead to evaluate. The final horizon year equals \code{CUTOFF_YEAR + HORIZON}.}

\item{YEAR_LENGTH}{Number of day within each year. Censoring day is computed as \code{CUTOFF_YEAR*YEAR_LENGTH}.}

\item{GRAD_EXTENSION}{Scalar multiplier to account for extra graduation sessions. Last day useful for graduation is computed as \code{CUTOFF_YEAR*YEAR_LENGTH+ GRAD_EXTENSION*YEAR_LENGTH}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row per subject-exam containing the probability of
completing that exam within the target horizon. Exams already completed
before the cutoff are omitted.
}
\description{
For every student-exam pair still pending at the end of \code{CUTOFF_YEAR},
compute the probability that the exam will be passed by the end of academic
year \code{CUTOFF_YEAR + HORIZON}, conditioning on the truncated history. The
forecast mirrors the internal machinery of \code{\link[=predict_k_years]{predict_k_years()}} but keeps the
probabilities at the exam level.
