\usage{
predict_outcome_full(
  FIT,
  TARGET_YEARS = FIT$data$data_dims$yb,
  YEAR_LENGTH = 365,
  GRAD_EXTENSION = 1.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{FIT}{Fitted object returned by \code{\link[=fit_EM]{fit_EM()}} or \code{\link[=fit_BFGS]{fit_BFGS()}}.}

\item{TARGET_YEARS}{Integer vector of academic years for which cumulative
probabilities should be returned. Defaults to the model horizon
(\code{FIT$data$data_dims$yb}).}

\item{YEAR_LENGTH}{Number of day within each year. Censoring day is computed as \code{CUTOFF_YEAR*YEAR_LENGTH}.}

\item{GRAD_EXTENSION}{Scalar multiplier to account for extra graduation sessions. Last day useful for graduation is computed as \code{CUTOFF_YEAR*YEAR_LENGTH+ GRAD_EXTENSION*YEAR_LENGTH}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row per student and target year containing
\code{prob_graduation}, \code{prob_dropout}, \code{prob_transfer}, and
\code{prob_still_enrolled}, together with the posterior EAP ability/speed
computed from exams only.
}
\description{
Compute the probability that each student experiences graduation, dropout,
transfer, or remains enrolled by the end of selected academic years,
conditioning on the complete exam history (ignoring observed outcomes). The
function mirrors the competing-risk component used during fitting and is
useful to assess the calibration of the hazard parameters in isolation.
